This training is about mastering the python programming to use it in different 
contexts from problem solving, maths, AI, Web Development, Desktop, Hacking and Testing.
where I learned from peter norvig that if I want to be a great programmer I must
play and master the tools that I am playing with.
python, .NET, SQL, C/C++, will be my main tools to develop software.
I am very surprised of how it is not fair to wait all this time to get a job
but there are no problems.
