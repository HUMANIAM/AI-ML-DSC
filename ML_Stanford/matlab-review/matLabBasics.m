%%%%% MATLAB is an interactive program for numerical computation and data visualization. 
% every variable in matlab clis an array or matrix 
x = 1;      % 1 by 1 matrix


% decimal point in matlab 4 after point
% format long make it 16. format bank make it 2
% format long e; will display the long result in exponential format
% format rate gives the closest rational expresion e.g. 0.333 * 1 = 333/100


%%%%%%%    Vectors are one dimensions arrays   %%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%   **********************************   %%%%%%%%%%
% there are two types 1- row  2- column
r = [1, 2, 3];
c = [1; 2; 3];
m = [1, 2; 3, 4];
